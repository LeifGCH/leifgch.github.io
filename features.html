        <h3>GUIDE</h3>
        <h4>In Fishing Industry, the goal is to fish things to sell and consume. Along the way you will meet many unforgettable (and sometimes forgettable) characters that aid your journey. Throughout the game, there are many tough fish with hard practices. As always, the goal remains to catch them. Here is the guide to help with that.</h4>
        <h4>One of the first approaches is to level up your gear. Leveling up your gear will make the fish easier to catch and give you more experience from catching the fish to sell. For example, if you have a good boat, you can move faster than without it.</h4>
        <h4>Another approach is to use brute force. Every time you challenge the fish, you will learn more about their behaviors and even form your own strategy. This can even help with later fish in Fishing Industry.</h4>
        <h4>The last approach is to seek help. If you have a friend that has a good strategy, they can teach it to you and you can use it for fish of any kind. Sometimes, the best knowledge is preacquired.</h4>
